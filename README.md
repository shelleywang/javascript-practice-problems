# Javascript Practice Problems

## about this repo

I'm using this repo to keep track of my progress on working on some practice problems in Javascript. 

I will be sourcing the problems from a few different places, including: [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com/) 

Every problem is going to have its own directory which will contain two .js files: 

* problem-xx.js: Problem explanation, skeleton for solution, and test cases
* problem-xx-solution.js: My implementation of a solution

Feel free to use this for your own practicing and just ignore all of my solution.js files.

Cheers!

## updates
2015-07-13 : Renaming the repo. I learned that Project Euler prefers if solutions are not publicly posted, so I would like to disassociate this repo from them.

2015-07-10 : Starting date!
