# Project Euler

## about this repo

I'm using this repo to keep track of my progress on working through Project Euler in Javascript. 

Every problem is going to have its own directory which will contain two .js files: 

* problem-xx.js: Problem explanation, skeleton for solution, and test cases
* problem-xx-solution.js: My implementation of a solution

Feel free to use this for your own investigation into Project Euler and just ignore all of my solution.js files.

Cheers!
